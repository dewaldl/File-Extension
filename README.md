This is a repository containing all the source code and files relating to the development of the .dse file extension.
.dse stands for "Data Symmetrically Encrypted" with refers to the key and method used to encrypt .dse files before storing them.

The Goals for this project are:
- Make it useable and practical

I would like to be able to use this format whenever saving something as a .dse, however that is still far in the foreseable future.
Any contributions or suggestions are welcome and I will try to inspect and consider each and every one of them.

Thank you for showing interesest in the development of the file extension: '.dse'.

Author and Head-Developer, Tristan
